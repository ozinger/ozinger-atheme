Help for VHOST:

VHOST allows operators to set a virtual host (also
known as a spoof or cloak) on an account. This vhost
will be set on the user immediately and each time
they log in. If no vhost is specified, clear any
existing vhost.

Syntax: VHOST <account> [<vhost>]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VHOST spb may.explode.on.impact
    /msg &nick& VHOST nenolod
