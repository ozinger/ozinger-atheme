Help for POST:

POST allows you to post one-time messages to all users (that will be sent when
you run the command) or messages that all users will see upon connect.

IMPORTANCE:
    Importance defines the type of message that will be sent.

    1 - Only display to users upon connect.
    2 - Send a notice to all users now.
    3 - Display message to all users upon connect AND send a notice to
            all users now.
    4 - Send a privmsg/query to all users now. It is important to note that this
            may annoy users and should only be used when absolutely necessary.


Syntax: POST <importance> <subject> <message>

Example:
    /msg &nick& 2 Info1 Some important information for users.
